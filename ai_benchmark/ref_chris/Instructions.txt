\f0\fs24 \cf0 Instructions for running tests:\
\
To use the script, you need to open up a jupyter notebook using \'93sudo jupyter notebook --allow-root\'94 in the user\'92s home directory, as some of the commands in the script require sudo privileges.\
The tests are configured for my own system, so you will have to replace all of the instances of \'93chris\'94 with whichever user is going to run the benchmarks.\
\
Currently 4 tests are working:\
translation\
recommendation\
sentiment analysis\
reinforcement\
\
with potentially 3 more on the way:\
object detection\
image classification\
speech recognition\
\
Results will be output within the jupyter notebook. Some will also store them as .log files stored within the benchmarks\'92 respective directories.\
I have attached what the jupyter notebook from running on Exxact as a reference so that you can see approximately what the results may look like as well as a fresh notebook. The reference notebook has not run the tests all the way through, as that would take days to do. However, the results of our testing are attached separately.}
